# bn-vr — Vulnerability Research Methodology

Use this skill when the user wants to find vulnerabilities, audit for bugs, check security, or analyze attack surface in a binary. This is a methodology guide — it tells you *what to look for and why*. For command syntax, see the `bn` skill.

## Attack Surface Identification

Start by mapping what the binary does and where untrusted data enters:

1. **Dangerous imports** — scan for functions with known vulnerability history:
   ```bash
   bn imports
   ```
   Flag these categories:
   - **Unbounded copies**: `strcpy`, `strcat`, `sprintf`, `gets`, `scanf` (no length limit)
   - **Bounded but misusable**: `strncpy`, `snprintf`, `memcpy`, `memmove` (length may be attacker-controlled)
   - **Memory management**: `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, `free` (UAF, double-free, heap overflow)
   - **Execution**: `system`, `exec*`, `popen`, `dlopen` (command/code injection)
   - **Format strings**: any `*printf` family where the format argument could be user-controlled

2. **Input sources** — identify where external data enters:
   ```bash
   bn imports
   ```
   Look for: `read`, `recv`, `recvfrom`, `fgets`, `fread`, `getenv`, `argv` access patterns. These are your taint sources.

3. **Interesting strings** — format strings, SQL fragments, shell commands, and paths hint at injection surfaces:
   ```bash
   bn strings --query "%s\|%x\|%n\|SELECT\|INSERT\|/bin/" --no-crt --min-length 4
   ```
   Use `--no-crt` to suppress locale/CRT noise and `--min-length` to skip short fragments. Use `--section .rodata` to restrict to read-only data.

4. **Memory layout** — understand which regions are writable, executable, or both:
   ```bash
   bn sections
   ```
   Look for writable+executable sections (W+X) — these are high-value targets for code injection. Check section sizes and ranges to understand the binary's memory layout.

## Input Tracing: Sources to Sinks

The core of VR is connecting *where data comes from* to *where it's used dangerously*.

### Forward tracing (from source)
Start at an input function and trace where its output flows:
```bash
bn xrefs read
bn callsites read --within <handler_function>
bn decompile <handler_function>
```
Read the decompilation: does the buffer from `read()` flow into `strcpy()`, `sprintf()`, or `system()` without validation?

### Backward tracing (from sink)
Start at a dangerous function and trace where its arguments come from:
```bash
bn xrefs strcpy
bn callsites strcpy --within <function>
```
For each callsite, examine: is the source argument bounded? Is the destination buffer large enough? Can the attacker control the source?

### Multi-hop tracing
Data often passes through several functions before reaching a sink. Follow it step by step:
1. Identify the sink callsite and its arguments
2. Trace each argument back through the caller's locals and parameters
3. Use `bn xrefs` on the caller to find *its* callers
4. Repeat until you reach an input source or lose the trail

## Common Vulnerability Patterns

When reading decompiled output, watch for these patterns:

### Buffer overflows
- Fixed-size stack buffer (`char buf[64]`) with unbounded copy (`strcpy(buf, user_input)`)
- `memcpy` where the length comes from untrusted input without bounds checking
- Off-by-one in loop bounds writing to a buffer (`<= len` instead of `< len`)
- Integer truncation before allocation: `uint16_t len = attacker_controlled_uint32` then `malloc(len)`

### Format string vulnerabilities
- `printf(user_input)` or `sprintf(buf, user_input)` — the format argument must be a literal, never user-controlled
- Look for `%n` capability which allows arbitrary memory writes
- Check `syslog`, `fprintf`, `snprintf` — all `*printf` variants are affected

### Integer issues
- Arithmetic before allocation: `size = count * element_size` can overflow, leading to undersized allocation
- Signed/unsigned confusion: negative value passing a signed check but wrapping to large unsigned
- Truncation: 32-bit value stored in 16-bit variable before use as length

### Use-after-free
- `free(obj)` followed by continued use of `obj` — look for functions that free a structure member but the caller still holds a reference
- Event handlers that free an object while iteration over a list containing it continues
- Error paths that free resources but don't null the pointer, allowing reuse on retry

### Off-by-one
- Loop bounds: `for (i = 0; i <= len; i++)` writes one past the buffer
- Null terminator not accounted for: `malloc(strlen(s))` instead of `malloc(strlen(s) + 1)`
- Fence-post errors in index calculations

### Command/path injection
- User input concatenated into a string passed to `system()`, `popen()`, or `exec*()`
- Path traversal: user-supplied filename with `../` not sanitized before `open()`

## Systematic Audit Workflow

Choose an approach based on the binary:

### Pattern-based (faster, good for large binaries)
1. Search for dangerous sinks: `bn xrefs strcpy`, `bn xrefs sprintf`, etc.
2. For each callsite, trace the arguments backward to check for attacker control
3. Skip callsites where arguments are provably safe (constants, bounded copies)
4. Prioritize callsites where arguments come from input sources

### Function-by-function (thorough, good for small/critical binaries)
1. List all functions and triage by relevance (input handlers, parsers, protocol implementations)
2. Decompile each target function and read line by line
3. For each potential issue, trace forward and backward to confirm exploitability
4. Track which functions are audited to avoid gaps

### Hybrid approach
1. Start pattern-based to find low-hanging fruit
2. Switch to function-by-function for high-value code (parsers, auth, crypto)

## Manual Taint Analysis

When you need to rigorously track whether attacker-controlled data reaches a dangerous operation:

1. **Mark sources** — identify which function parameters or return values carry untrusted data:
   ```bash
   bn decompile <input_handler>
   ```

2. **Propagate taint** — trace through assignments, copies, and function calls:
   - Direct assignment: `dest = tainted_src` -> `dest` is tainted
   - Copy: `memcpy(dest, tainted_src, len)` -> `dest` is tainted
   - Function call: if a tainted value is passed as an argument, check whether the callee propagates it to its return value or to other outputs
   ```bash
   bn callsites <function> --within <caller>
   bn decompile <callee>
   ```

3. **Check sinks** — when tainted data reaches a dangerous function, assess exploitability:
   - Can the attacker control enough of the input to trigger the bug?
   - Are there length checks, sanitization, or canaries in the path?
   - What is the memory layout at the target (stack vs heap, adjacent allocations)?

## Reporting Findings

For each potential vulnerability, capture:

- **Location**: function name and address
- **Bug class**: buffer overflow, format string, integer overflow, UAF, etc.
- **Trigger condition**: what input causes the vulnerable path to execute
- **Root cause**: why the code is wrong (missing bounds check, unchecked return value, etc.)
- **Impact**: what an attacker can achieve (crash, code execution, info leak, privilege escalation)
- **Data flow**: the path from input source to vulnerable sink, including intermediate functions
- **Proof of concept**: if possible, describe or construct an input that triggers the bug
